Vert.x Health Check Booster
---------------------------

The purpose of this booster is to demonstrate how the Kubernetes health
checks works in order to determine if a container is still alive (=
liveness) and ready to serve (= readiness) the traffic for the
application`s HTTP endpoints. To demonstrate this behavior, the
application configures a `/health` HTTP endpoint which is used by
Kubernetes to issue HTTP requests. If the container is still alive, as
the Health HTTP endpoint is able to reply, the management platform will
receive 200 as return code and then no further action is required. But,
once you click the `kill me` button, the HTTP endpoint does not return a
response, then the platform will restart the pod. As the pod will be
down for a certain period of time, this UI polls periodically the
service until it is restarted. During this amount of time, do NOT
refresh the page, as it wonâ€™t be served until the application has been
restarted.
